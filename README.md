# SFINAE-and-Metaprogramming
Examples to practice and better understand Template Metaprogramming and SFINAE.

For a quick dive into Non-type Template Metapgrogramming(examples: Power and RangedSum) I referred to:

For Template Metaprogramming with SFINAE (examples: MetaCalculator) I referred to:

There is also usage of concepts and how it reduces the tediousness of previous ways of applying SFINAE and recursion examples done via template metaprogramming.
